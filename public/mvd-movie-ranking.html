<h1>Marsy's favorite movies watched.</h1>
<h2>This is my top three movies.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Glass Onion </h3>
<p>An exciting and suspenseful action film, 
unwilling to stop watching in order to not miss anything. Uncertain whether the second round 
would be equally exciting. But perhaps give it a shot and see for yourself.</p>

<h3>The Tomorrow War</h3>
<p>This is an action filled adventure movie that 
will keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Great Si-fi and the actors did an awesome job. 
Will watch it a thousand times over.</p>

<h3>Mother</h3>
<p>Though not a highly recognized film, 
it is definitely worth seeing. 
We were not even aware that this was an old 
film. There is a lot of action and a fantastic 
twists. Likewise extremely intense.</p>
